# Home Assistant Integration with WAGO PLC 750- series

This integration makes use of the webvisu protocol used by the web visualisations as proviced by CoDeSys V2.3.  It offers a much greater flexibility than MODBUS as there is no need to prepare / publish specific addresses.  Direct access to all variables (even internal ones) is possible (=> be careful what you do...).

It has been built thanks to the guidance of https://github.com/msp1974/HAIntegrationExamples. @msp1974 I couldn't have done it without you.

To do:
1. Describe preparation steps (how to generate XML file from CoDeSys)
2. Describe the rules of building the element cofiguration (YMAL)
3. Explain other configuration options
